MLFinLab is an open source package based on the research of Dr Marcos Lopez de Prado in his new book
Advances in Financial Machine Learning. This implementation started out as a platform for which Ashutosh and
Jacques could base their research project on for their [Masters in Financial Engineering at WorldQuant University](https://wqu.org/).

As we were working through the book we saw the opportunity to code up the implementations as well answer the 
questions at the back of every chapter. 

## Barriers to Entry
As most of you know, getting through the first 3 chapters of the book is challenging as it relies on HFT data to 
create the new financial data structures. Sourcing the HFT data is very difficult and thus we have resorted to purchasing the full history of S&P500 Emini futures tick data from [TickData LLC](https://www.tickdata.com/).

We are not affiliated with TickData in any way but would like to recommend others to make use of their service. The full history cost us about $750 and is worth every penny. They have really done a great job at cleaning the data and providing it in a user friendly manner. 

### Sample Data
TickData does offer about 20 days worth of raw tick data which can be sourced from their website [link](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tick-data-s3/downloads/ES_Sample.zip).

For those of you interested in working with a two years of sample tick, volume, and dollar bars, it is provided for in the [research repo.](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research/tree/master/Sample-Data).

You should be able to work on a few implementations of the code with this set.

## Notes
* Added Chapter 5 code (Frac Diff)
* Added Chapter 3 code (Labeling)
* Added Imbalance and Run bars.
* Added standard bar types (tick, volume, dollar). 
* Works on BIG csv files 25Gigs and up.
* Purchased high quality raw tick data.
* Email us if you would like a sample of the standard bars.
* Next we are busy adding the code for the labeling. See [research repo](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/research) for the Q&A work in progress for chapter 3.

## Getting Started

Recommended versions:
* Anaconda 3
* Python 3.6

### Installation for users
The package can be installed from the PyPi index via the console:
 1. Launch the terminal and run: ```pip install mlfinlab```

### Installation for developers
Clone the [package repo](https://github.com/hudson-and-thames/mlfinlab) to your local machine then follow the steps below.

#### Installation on Mac OS X and Ubuntu Linux
1. Make sure you install the latest version of the Anaconda 3 distribution. To do this you can follow the install and update instructions found on this link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#mac
2. Launch a terminal
3. Create a New Conda Environment. From terminal: ```conda create -n <env name> python=3.6 anaconda``` accept all the requests to install.
4. Now activate the environment with ```source activate <env name>```.
5. From Terminal: go to the directory where you have saved the file, example: cd Desktop/mlfinlab/.
6. Install Python requirements, by running the command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Installation on Windows
1. Download and install the latest version of [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
2. Launch Anaconda Navigator
3. Click Environments, choose an environment name, select Python 3.6, and click Create
4. Click Home, browse to your new environment, and click Install under Jupyter Notebook
5. Launch Anaconda Prompt and activate the environment: ```conda activate <env name>```
6. From Anaconda Prompt: go to the directory where you have saved the file, example: cd Desktop/mlfinlab/.
7. Install Python requirements, by running the command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### How To Run Checks Locally
On your local machine open the terminal and cd into the working dir. 
1. Code style checks: ```./pylint```
2. Unit tests: ```python -m unittest discover```
3. Code coverage: ```bash coverage```

## Additional Research Repo
BlackArbsCEO has a great repo based on de Prado's research. It covers many of the questions at the back of every chapter and was the first source on Github to do so. It has also been a good source of inspiration for our research.

## Contact us
At the moment the project is still rather small and thus I would recommend getting in touch with us over email so that we can further discuss the areas of contribution that interest you the most. As soon as we get to more than 4 maintainers we will switch over to a slack channel.

For now you can get hold us at: hudsonthames19@gmail.com

Looking forward to hearing from you!
